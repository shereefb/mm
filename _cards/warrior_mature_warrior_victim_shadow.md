 The [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow) is a [Warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) who loses touch with his [strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength) and [courage](/warrior/spirit/rebel/courage). He has the false belief that he shouldn't do things he's afraid of. He becomes a "pushover" and gives up easily on his dreams. He is depressed, lacks [confidence](/magician/heart/healer/confidence) and feels sorry for himself. He tries to get things from others by making them feel sorry for him, or guilty.   
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- Everything hurts too much, and everyone is against me.  
- Life is unfair, Poor me.  
- The world is too scary and the challenges are too big  
- I need to be hard on myself  
  
## Balancing the [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow)  
- If I'm attracting Bullies in my life, then the [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow) energy is out of [balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance) and taking over.   
- I get in touch with anger, [strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength) and [courage](/warrior/spirit/rebel/courage) of the [Bully](/warrior/mature_warrior/bully_shadow)  
- I remember that I am bigger than my fear, and I practice doing things that I'm afraid of.   
- I remember that having weakness, doesn't mean I'm weak.  
- I let go of the idea that the world is happening to me, and start making things happen myself.   
- I stop complaining and whining, and start taking action.   
- I develop self-[discipline](/warrior/body/athlete/discipline) to strengthen my body and control my mind.   
- I use my anger to say "no" when my boundaries are crossed.   
- I remember that some things are worth fighting for.  
- I find more mature warriors and ask them to challenge me and train me.   
  
## Gift of the [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow)  
If a [Warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) is stuck in [Bully](/warrior/mature_warrior/bully_shadow) energy, he can call on the gift of the [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow)'s [vulnerability](/warrior/mature_warrior/vulnerability) and sensitivity to get in touch with his pain and others.'  
  
**Off [Balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance):** In touch with [vulnerability](/warrior/mature_warrior/vulnerability) but loses touch with [strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength).  
**Qualities:** Self-pity. Pathetic. Whining. Complaining. Passive-Agressive.
