Mature [king](/king/mature_king) balances giving and receiving. Acknowledges limits.   
[Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow) focuses on taking  
[Weakling](/king/mature_king/weakling_shadow) gives without boundaries or limits. And is taken from.  
  
- Give with the heart. Flows like water. Generous with emotions. They are a gift. Don't hold with the heart. Don't determine with the heart.    
- Mature [king](/king/mature_king) lives at the edge of his generosity. giving no more than feels joyful, and no less than his heart desires.   
- Understands that everything is a gift. born with nothing. [will](/warrior/body/athlete/will) die with nothing. he is merely a custodial of the realm.   
- Sees everything as a flow. Receiving is part of the giving. Inhale is part of the exhale.   
- Because he lives in [gratitude](/lover/heart/care_giver/gratitude) for the gifts he received, he gives.   
- Because our deepest heart's longing is to give our gifts, he is grateful for the opportunity to give. and sees the giving as the receiving.   
- Is in touch with how abundant our world is. [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow) and [Weakling](/king/mature_king/weakling_shadow) live in scarcity. Win-Lose. Mature [king](/king/mature_king) sees the win win in every giving/recieving.   
- Enemy of giving is entitlement which destroys [gratitude](/lover/heart/care_giver/gratitude). Or scarcity which increases attachment and greed.

The [Weakling](/king/mature_king/weakling_shadow) lives in scarcity. Disconnected from the abundance in our world.

|In the story of Interbeing, life is a gift. The world and everything in it is a gift. We did not earn our lives. We did not earn the sun; it is not thanks to our hard efforts that it shines. We did not earn the ability of plants to grow. We did not earn water. We did not earn our conception nor our breath. Our hearts beat and our livers metabolize all on their own. Life is a gift. ~ Charles Eisenstein  
  
|When we apprehend these basic truths, [gratitude](/lover/heart/care_giver/gratitude) comes naturally. [Gratitude](/lover/heart/care_giver/gratitude) is the [knowledge](/magician/mature_magician/knowledge) of having received and the consequent desire to give in turn. It is primal. All beings including human beings have an unquenchable desire to pour forth their gifts. That is why if you are in a situation where your gifts are not valued, not received, or not useful, you [will](/warrior/body/athlete/will) want to leave that situation, that job or relationship. No matter how much you are being paid, no matter how scared you are to leave the relationship, you’re going to want to bust out and develop and express your capacity to give to the world in service of something you care about. ~ Charles Eisenstein  
  
|Speaking of poverty is another way of talking about surrender, about generosity, nonattachment, selflessness. But the state of poverty has a sense of sacredness. Poverty is so absent of everything that it is absolutely sacred. There are no contaminations, no impurities, nothing exists in it absolutely. It is so empty of everything, all attachments, all objects, all qualities, that it is absolute sacredness. The sense is that poverty is where God comes from, the abode of God. Poverty is the condition before anything comes to being. It is completely absolutely sacred because it has not been contaminated by anything occurring. No creation has happened yet. Nothing has occurred. Nothing has been said. Some people call poverty the great death. It is not just the death of you or your ego. It is the death of everything. The absolute cessation and annihilation of all that can be perceived, felt, experienced. It is pre-existence. ~A.H.Almaas  
  
|When there are no boundaries, what naturally arises is love, abundance, and generosity, because what blocks love are the boundaries. There is no sense then that you are going to love someone, or that you want someone to love you. You are just you; you are natural, you are just living a human life, and there is love in it, naturally. You do not say, “I want to do this because I want to be loving.” You just do it naturally. You are loving, without having to think about it. You do not have to feel compassionate to be helpful. You are helpful regardless of whether you feel helpful or not. [Compassion](/king/heart/peace_maker_and_diplomat/compassion) might be present; you might not even care about it. You are just helpful. So, in a sense, in the Work, nothing is for you; at the same time, everything is for you because you are everything. Each one of us can come to see that these are not ideas, that this is not a point of view. This is actually the fact, this is the state of affairs; it is how things are when your mind is not interpreting things. ~A.H.Almaas  
  
|Clearly, the most obvious thing is what all the traditions and teachings have said, which is to live selflessly: to give of oneself instead of accumulating for oneself. The more you give, the more generous you are, the more compassionate, the more loving, the more selfless you are, the less there is an identification with the person because the person is an experience of being an island. An island needs to be protected and enhanced, but if you don’t try to protect it or enhance it, then the generosity [will](/warrior/body/athlete/will) tend to eliminate the boundaries. Generosity is a good word because generosity is an openness. There is no holding back in true generosity. I don’t mean simply open and giving physically, but in all ways. It means not protecting yourself. I don’t mean not protecting yourself in the sense of not closing your doors at night. Not protecting yourself means not trying to build psychological boundaries, not trying to thicken your boundaries, but working on dissolving those boundaries. Generosity really is the heart of the oneness or the unity. When there is the experience of oneness, the heart is experienced as absolute generosity. There is absolutely no holding back. Whatever is there—love, [compassion](/king/heart/peace_maker_and_diplomat/compassion), understanding, [knowledge](/magician/mature_magician/knowledge), help—just flows out. But there is a tendency to protect yourself because of a lack understanding . It is not because you are bad. In a relative way, you exist, but if you think of who you are ultimately, you are not a person; yet a person is one of your manifestations. ~A.H.Almaas  
  
|When you see that your focus on your self, your separateness, your preoccupation with your personal life, are all barriers against the natural order of reality, you become more willing to be open and loving. There is no threat then about being generous. You see that generosity is our nature. There is no loss in letting go of your point of view; there is tremendous gain—yet no self gains it. The gain is everyone’s gain, the gain is for the universe. You [will](/warrior/body/athlete/will) feel [freedom](/lover/spirit/jester/freedom), joy, fulfillment and happiness—but these feelings are not for you to possess, they are for the universe. Whenever any human being loses his point of view, the entire human race benefits. Ultimately, the work we do to understand our lives and our selves is not for us individually, but for the good of everyone, for the earth as a whole. ~A.H.Almaas
