#draft pic Compassion is great  
[Balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance) Action and Empathy.   
Mature [king](/king/mature_king) allows for the pain of others, and lets his heart be touched and resonate with their pain. Tries to prevent unnecessary suffering.   
[Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow) is closed-hearted, and inflicts pain without compassion. Action without Empathy.   
[Weakling](/king/mature_king/weakling_shadow) doesn't want others to hurt, tries to protect them from pain and suffering with false compassion. Empathy without Action.   
  
Mature compassion does not try to change the pain, but brings a heart to it to allow it to transform. Holds the pain and meets it fully. Doesn't block necessary action.  And informs action with heart.
