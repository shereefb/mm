|"We are in the world, but not of the world"  
  
A Mature Magician is a star dancer. He connects the invisible world and the visible world. The world of spirit, and the world of matter.   
  
He knows that he is not of the world. He is not his body. He is not his mind or heart. He is a spirit/soul that is connected to a mystery outside of time and space. A Mature, and also knows that his spirit has chosen to come into the material world. To inhabit a body in time and space.   
  
In order to become a bridge between the world, the Magician respects both equally, and makes it his business to bring the mystery to life. To fully inhabit mater and honor it's sacred nature. He connects the "as above" to the "so below". To do this, the magician studies the way his body and his soul are connected. He creates sacred spaces in the physical world and tends them. Alters. Temples. He collects and respects sacred objects and symbols. He spends time in nature. He learns the way of the artist, bringing spirit into form through dance, music, poetry, painting, sculpting, and prayer. He learns to make his body, heart and mind and instrument for spirit to play.   
  
This is the Mature Magician as Priest. It is the vertical connection. Connecting Father Sky to Mother Earth.   
  
The Manipulator, is disconnected from spirit, and is lost in the world of the material. Because he is disconnected, matter is no longer sacred. He uses his knowledge to manipulate matter, instead of infusing it with spirit.   
Manipulator becomes materialist by disconnecting from above.  
  
The Dummy can become a space cadet by disconnecting from below. He is more concerned with the spirit world and doesn't respect the world of matter. He abdicates the tonal world and does a spiritual bypass. For the Dummy, the material world doesn't matter. And so again, he does not create sacred space.
