#draft pic Compassion is great  
Balance Action and Empathy.   
Mature king allows for the pain of others, and lets his heart be touched and resonate with their pain. Tries to prevent unnecessary suffering.   
Tyrant is closed-hearted, and inflicts pain without compassion. Action without Empathy.   
Weakling doesn't want others to hurt, tries to protect them from pain and suffering with false compassion. Empathy without Action.   
  
Mature compassion does not try to change the pain, but brings a heart to it to allow it to transform. Holds the pain and meets it fully. Doesn't block necessary action.  And informs action with heart.
