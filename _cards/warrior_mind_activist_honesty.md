The Mature Warrior's sword is his Honesty. A Mature Warrior balances telling the truth, and kindness. He doesn't let one defeat the other.   
  
The Bully uses the truth to get what they want. They only choose the parts of the truth that suit them in order to control others and use force. When the Bully tells the truth, they don't care about people’s heart and just blurt it out. Because they do this without kindness, the truth does not penetrate. It hurts.   
  
The Victim keeps the truth in because they are trying to be kind. They lie to themselves and others. Because they are afraid to hurt people they put down their sword of truth. This means they also can't hear other warriors' feedback because it hurts them.   
  
Honesty can be scary. It requires a warriors courage. The hardest kind of honesty, is honesty with yourself.  
  
The Mature Warrior tells the truth and includes the fact that he cares about their (feelings heart- don't understand) as part of the truth. He lets other people's feedback impact him without taking it personally.  
  
  
## Honesty Principles   
- Never lie.   
- Say what you mean, mean what you say.   
- Stop speaking if someone isn’t listening. Your words are too precious to waste.   
- Confront lies, and untruths in yourself and others.   
- Don’t say things that make you feel weaker.   
- Hold your opinions lightly.   
- Assume there’s always more truth than what you can see.   
- Go into silence until you know the truth.  
- Real kindness is being honest **and** open-hearted.

|HONESTY is reached through the doorway of grief and loss. Where we cannot go in our mind, our memory, or our body is where we cannot be straight with another, with the world, or with our self. The fear of loss, in one form or another, is the motivator behind all conscious and unconscious dishonesties: all of us are afraid of loss, in all its forms, all of us, at times, are haunted or overwhelmed by the possibility of a disappearance, and all of us therefore, are one short step away from dishonesty. Every human being dwells intimately close to a door of revelation they are afraid to pass through. Honesty lies in understanding our close and necessary relationship with not wanting to hear the truth. The ability to speak the truth is as much the ability to describe what it is like to stand in trepidation at this door, as it is to actually go through it and become that beautifully honest spiritual warrior, equal to all circumstances, we would like to become. Honesty is not the revealing of some foundational truth that gives us power over life or another or even the self, but a robust incarnation into the unknown unfolding vulnerability of existence, where we acknowledge how powerless we feel, how little we actually know, how afraid we are of not knowing and how astonished we are by the generous measure of loss that is conferred upon even the most average life. Honesty is grounded in humility and indeed in humiliation, and in admitting exactly where we are powerless. Honesty is not found in revealing the truth, but in understanding how deeply afraid of it we are. To become honest is in effect to become fully and robustly incarnated into powerlessness. Honesty allows us to live with not knowing. We do not know the full story, we do not know where we are in the story; we do not know who is at fault or who will carry the blame in the end. Honesty is not a weapon to keep loss and heartbreak at bay, honesty is the outer diagnostic of our ability to come to ground in reality, the hardest attainable ground of all, the place where we actually dwell, the living, breathing frontier where there is no realistic choice between gain or loss. ~ David Whyte
