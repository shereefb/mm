Mature lover understands joy is an inside job  
Addict thinks it comes from the outside and chases it  
Hermit is disconnected from it, and doesn't think it exists.   
Hermit can help addict look inwards.   
Addict can help Hermit believe it exists and go out and get it.   
When both are balanced, the mature lover believes joy exists and looks inwards for it, gifting his joy to the world.
