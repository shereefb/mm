#draft   
challenging others. Challenging self. Seeking challenge. Receiving challenge. Balancing acceptance and drive.   
  
Attuning to others and creating challenges that help them mature and grow. Don’t crush. Don’t accommodate. Take on a challenge willingly.   
  
Face adversity and win. Witness self and other. Be in integrity with self and other.   
  
The mature masculine thrives in a good challenge. It unleashed his potential. Resistance build strength and power. Mature warrior challenges all four archetypes in self and other.   
  
Also challenges others to grow. In the stretch zone. Doesn’t tear and doesn’t succumb to comfort.
