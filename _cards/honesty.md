The Mature Warrior's sword is his Honesty. A Mature Warrior balances telling the truth, and kindness. He doesn't let one defeat the other.   
  
The Bully uses the truth to get what they want. They only choose the parts of the truth that suit them in order to control others and use force. When the Bully tells the truth, they don't care about people’s heart and just blurt it out. Because they do this without kindness, the truth does not penetrate. It hurts.   
  
The Victim keeps the truth in because they are trying to be kind. They lie to themselves and others. Because they are afraid to hurt people they put down their sword of truth. This means they also can't hear other warriors' feedback because it hurts them.   
  
Honesty can be scary. It requires a warriors courage. The hardest kind of honesty, is honesty with yourself.  
  
The Mature Warrior tells the truth and includes the fact that he cares about their (feelings heart- don't understand) as part of the truth. He lets other people's feedback impact him without taking it personally.  
  
  
## Honesty Principles   
- Never lie.   
- Say what you mean, mean what you say.   
- Stop speaking if someone isn’t listening. Your words are too precious to waste.   
- Confront lies, and untruths in yourself and others.   
- Don’t say things that make you feel weaker.   
- Hold your opinions lightly.   
- Assume there’s always more truth than what you can see.   
- Go into silence until you know the truth.  
- Real kindness is being honest **and** open-hearted.
