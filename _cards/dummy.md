 The Dummy is a Magician that doesn't want the responsibility that comes from the knowledge. He doesn't want to share, teach or help others. He does not want to do the work to steward a sacred space, or to know himself.  
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I'm not in touch with my creativity and brilliance, so I can't serve myself or others and need other magicians to do things for me.   
- I don't know, and I can't figure it out.   
- I am worse than others because I know less.  
- I compare myself to other people and find ways that I'm worse than them.   
- If I think I'm going to fail at something, I don't try.   
- I don't want to make mistakes.   
- It's easier not to make an effort, and to criticize the efforts of others.  
  
## Balancing the Dummy  
- I recognize that to serve the realm I need to acquire knowledge.   
- I get in touch with the confidence of the Manipulator to feel less helpless and overwhelmed.  
- I find Magicians that I respect and ask them to teach me and initiate me.   
- Begin comparing myself to the past instead of others.  
- I get in touch with my curiosity and wonder about the world. I let them guide me to learn.  
- I remember that confidence doesn't come from knowing everything, it comes from learning to figure things out.   
- I learn to meditate so I can detach and connect to the mystery.   
  
  
## Gift of the Dummy  
When the Magician is in the Manipulator shadow, he needs the gift of "beginner's mind." This helps him be in touch with mystery and humility.  
  
**Off Balance:** Believes that the mystery is too much and loses touch with his capacity to know.  
**Qualities:** Ignorance. False Humility. Lack of curiosity. Fear of failure.
