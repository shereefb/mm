|“Don't be afraid of your fears. They're not there to scare you. They're there to let you know that something is worth it.”  
  
|“A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for.”   
  
|“Scared is what you're feeling. Brave is what you're doing.”   
  
|"Safety third."  
  
|“Courage is resistance to fear, [mastery](/magician/mature_magician/mastery) of fear - not absence of fear.”   
  
Fear is normal. Fear is good. Fear is what warns you when when things are dangerous. Fear is what makes you prepare. Fear keeps us out of a lot of trouble. So there is nothing wrong with fear. But fear can also be overwhelming. It can be unreasonable. It can cause you to freeze up and make bad decisions or hesitate when you need to act. So you have to learn to control fear.   
  
And that's what courage is. Learning that we are bigger than fear. Learning to listen to it, but not let it control us. Learning to [respect](/king/spirit/leader/respect) fear, but put it in its place. So we can act when we need to act, grow when we need to grow, and face what we need to face.   
  
Bullies don't accept their fear. The deny it and so they scare others. Victims feel their fear, but they let it take charge of their lives and make all the decisions. A true [warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) lets himself be afraid, and makes his decision including the fear, but also including many other factors.
