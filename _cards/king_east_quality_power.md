|"Power is the ability to do good things for others."  
  
|"When the power of love overcomes the love of power, there will be peace."  
  
|"The measure of a man is what he does with power."  
  
The Mature King understands that the key to owning his power, is allowing his hatred. He uses the hatred to connect to his power and serve the realm. He understands that good and evil are inside of him. And not something thatâ€™s out there to be eliminated.   
  
He does this by feeling his hatred fully, and letting its energy fill his heart and his body, but never discharging it. By accepting the hatred in his body, not denying it, and not acting it out, he let's his body transform hatred into pure power.   
  
The Tyrant, feels the hatred, but cannot hold it in his body so he turns it outwards and discharges it. The Weakling, denies the hatred, and tries not to feel it. He represses it, and doesn't let it into his body. This way, he cuts himself off from his power.   
  
When the Tyrant discharges his power, he turns it outwards towards others in violence. The power then leaves his body and hurts others, leaving him weak and unbalanced. This Tyrant energy disturbs the peace and starts war.   
  
When the Weakling avoids owning his power he acts "nice" and pretends to like things he doesn't, and accepts things that don't work. He does this because he is afraid to lose the relationships in his life, and doesn't want to scare people with his power. Weakling energy creates a "fake" peace because the weakling is battling inside himself with hatred.  
  
When the King lets his power fill his body, mind, and heart, he is peaceful and centered. Pure power doesn't hurt anyone. It does not attack or violate others, and does not allow others to attack or violate. Mature King power creates true peace.
