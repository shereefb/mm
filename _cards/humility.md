 #draft The Mature Warrior understands that dignity and defeat can co-exist. He knows that his value and self-worth comes from how he meets winning or losing, not whether or not he wins or loses. He is graceful in winning, and dignified in losing.   
  
Victims and Bullies think that the only thing that matters is winning. They incorrectly think that their value and self-worth comes from winning and avoiding losing.   
  
The Bully does not acknowledge defeat. He gloats when winning, and gets enraged when losing.  To maintain a false sense of dignity, he forgets his defeats quickly and tries to move on. Never learning to be humble.  
  
The Victim loses his dignity when defeated. He mopes when losing, and pretends to have false humility when winning. Because he's afraid of losing, he doesn't have the courage to try things that are challenging, and gets weaker with time.   
  
Because the victim is humiliated by limitation and failure, he attracts bullies that humiliate him. Because the Bully refuses humility, they humiliate others.   
  
The Mature Warrior lets his limitation bring humility. He defends against bullying voices and keeps his dignity. He knows his worth and meets his limitations.  
He becomes like water. Staying close to the earth and respecting his limits. Like water, he uses patience and persistence to carve through rock.  
  
When the Bully and Victim fall to their knees, they are humiliated and hang their head down in shame. Their shame comes from not having tried their best before being defeated. When the Warrior falls to his knees, he is humbled. Because he has tried his best, he is not humiliated. He connects to the source to reflect, heal and learn. He finds balance again, and gets back on the battlefield.    
  
The victim bends his head in self-pity. The Warrior bends his head down to look inwards, to reflect. To listen to his body and his heart.
