#printed The Addict is a lover who is avoiding pain and focused on the outside world for pleasure. He's always restless, and always searching for something "more." He is hungry to experience the next thing, and doesn't accept limit on his pleasure or recognize healthy boundaries.  
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- There is only a small number of things that bring me pleasure.  
- It's better to feel good now and not worry about consequences in the future.  
- I try to numb past pain by today's pleasure.   
- I connect to others to avoid connecting with myself.  
- I avoid pain by only trying to experience good things.   
- I refuse limits on my sensual pleasure.  
  
  
## Balancing the Addict  
- I connect to my pain and grief and feel it fully. I stop running from it and numbing it.  
- I remember to connect to myself before others.  
- I accept that there is a very wide range of experiences of being alive and I welcome it all.  
- I recognize that, while there is no limit to love, there are healthy limits to every kind of pleasure.   
- I learn to meditate, so I can detach and gain distance from my feelings.  
- I set boundaries for myself and others, so I can gain distance and seperateness.
