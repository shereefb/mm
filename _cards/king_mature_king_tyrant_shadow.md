 The [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow) exploits and abuses others. He is ruthless, merciless, and without feeling when he is pursuing what he thinks is his own self-interest. He hates all beauty, all innocence, all [strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength), all talent, all life energy. He does so because he lacks inner structure, and he is afraid of his own hidden weakness and his underlying lack of potency.  
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I use my [power](/king/mature_king/power) to boss people to get what I want and serve myself  
- Instead of [responsibility](/king/mature_king/responsibility), I try to take control.  
- I reject and attack weakness in myself and others.  
- Evil is out there, and can be squashed  
- I try to force order on everyone because I can't handle the chaos  
  
## Balancing the [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow)  
- If I'm attracting weaklings into my life then the [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow) energy is out of [balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance) and taking over.  
- I get in touch with the [Weakling](/king/mature_king/weakling_shadow). I feel his [vulnerability](/warrior/mature_warrior/vulnerability) and out of controlness, and I accept his qualities as a part of me.   
- I stop doing for others what they can do for themselves.   
- I [respect](/king/spirit/leader/respect) other people's [freedom](/lover/spirit/jester/freedom) to be who they are, and do what they want.  
- I focus on making requests and not demands.   
- I remember that nobody owes me anything unless they agreed to it.   
- I notice when people are saying "yes" just because they are scared of me.  
- I feel the [compassion](/king/heart/peace_maker_and_diplomat/compassion) in my heart, and my love for people, and use my [power](/king/mature_king/power) to serve with love.   
- I notice and let go of my addiction to be needed so I can feel important.  
  
## Gift of the [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow)  
When the [King](/king/mature_king) is in his [Weakling](/king/mature_king/weakling_shadow) shadow, I let him feel my [power](/king/mature_king/power) and hatred to [balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance) him.   
  
**Off [Balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance):** Tries to make Order defeat Chaos through control  
**Qualities:** Blame, Self-importance, Hatred
