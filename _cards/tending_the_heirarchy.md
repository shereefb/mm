#draft No one capable stays down. No one incapable rises. Not on my watch.   
  
Hierarchy of competence and reciprocity. Doesn't care if he's on top or bottom. Cares he's in the right place and that others are in their right place. Understands that it's critical to protect the hierarchy from corruption and greed and hunger for power. But also doesn't confuse hierarchy with corrupt hierarchy.   
Tyrant. Hierarchy of power dominance. Doesn't respect competence or learning. Only cares to be on top.   
Weakling non participation in hierarchy. Doesn't belong to a hierarchy. Doesn't acknowledge the need for those more competent than him because he's afraid of their dominance and abuse. Doesn't take responsibility for those less dominant than him because he doesn't trust himself with powerÂ
