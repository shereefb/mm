 The [Dummy](/magician/mature_magician/dummy_shadow) is a [Magician](/[magician](/magician/mature_magician)/mature_magician) that doesn't want the [responsibility](/king/mature_king/responsibility) that comes from the [knowledge](/magician/mature_magician/knowledge). He doesn't want to share, teach or help others. He does not want to do the work to steward a sacred space, or to know himself.  
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I'm not in touch with my [creativity](/magician/body/creator/creativity) and brilliance, so I can't serve myself or others and need other magicians to do things for me.   
- I don't know, and I can't figure it out.   
- I am worse than others because I know less.  
- I compare myself to other people and find ways that I'm worse than them.   
- If I think I'm going to fail at something, I don't try.   
- I don't want to make mistakes.   
- It's easier not to make an effort, and to criticize the efforts of others.  
  
## Balancing the [Dummy](/magician/mature_magician/dummy_shadow)  
- I recognize that to serve the realm I need to acquire [knowledge](/magician/mature_magician/knowledge).   
- I get in touch with the [confidence](/magician/heart/healer/confidence) of the [Manipulator](/magician/mature_magician/manipulator_shadow) to feel less helpless and overwhelmed.  
- I find Magicians that I [respect](/king/spirit/leader/respect) and ask them to teach me and initiate me.   
- Begin comparing myself to the past instead of others.  
- I get in touch with my [curiosity](/magician/mind/sage/curiosity) and [wonder](/lover/mind/innocent/wonder) about the world. I let them guide me to learn.  
- I remember that [confidence](/magician/heart/healer/confidence) doesn't come from knowing everything, it comes from learning to figure things out.   
- I learn to meditate so I can detach and connect to the mystery.   
  
  
## Gift of the [Dummy](/magician/mature_magician/dummy_shadow)  
When the [Magician](/[magician](/magician/mature_magician)/mature_magician) is in the [Manipulator](/magician/mature_magician/manipulator_shadow) shadow, he needs the gift of "[beginner's mind](/magician/mind/sage/beginner's_mind)." This helps him be in touch with mystery and [humility](/warrior/heart/explorer/humility).  
  
**Off [Balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/[balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance)):** Believes that the mystery is too much and loses touch with his capacity to know.  
**Qualities:** Ignorance. False [Humility](/warrior/heart/explorer/[humility](/warrior/heart/explorer/humility)). Lack of [curiosity](/magician/mind/sage/curiosity). Fear of failure.
