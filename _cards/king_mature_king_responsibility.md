The [Weakling](/king/mature_king/weakling_shadow) thinks that responsibility is a burden that reduces his [freedom](/lover/spirit/jester/freedom). He doesn't understand that avoiding responsibility is the opposite of [freedom](/lover/spirit/jester/freedom). The less responsibility he takes, the weaker he gets, which leads to taking less responsibility. This makes the [weakling](/king/mature_king/weakling_shadow) always depend on other people to take care of his realm. He becomes less free, and attracts tyrants into his life who [will](/warrior/body/athlete/will) manipulate and control him.   
  
The [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow) tries to control others. This makes them weak and keeps him in control. He does things for others that they can do for themselves. He loses his [freedom](/lover/spirit/jester/freedom) this way because he attracts weaklings into his life that demand that he takes care of them. Because he is always trying to control everything, the [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow) can never relax or rest, and is never free.  
  
The Mature [King](/[king](/king/mature_king)/mature_king) understands that the more he is responsible for others, the free-er he his. He takes as much responsibility as he can, and expects others to be responsible for themselves. He learns from the wolf. He leads his pack but expects them to be responsible. This allows him to play with them as equals. He doesn't control them, and doesn't leave them. As part of a pack, he makes sure he is contributing and carrying his own weight. If he needs help he asks for it, until he can get back on his feet. If he's asked for help, he gives it only to the point where the other wolf can take care of himself. If a wolf does not take care of his responsibilities, eventually the pack leaves him, and he learns the hard way to take care of himself.
