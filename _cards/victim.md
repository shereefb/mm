 The Victim is a Warrior who loses touch with his strength and courage. He has the false belief that he shouldn't do things he's afraid of. He becomes a "pushover" and gives up easily on his dreams. He is depressed, lacks confidence and feels sorry for himself. He tries to get things from others by making them feel sorry for him, or guilty.   
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- Everything hurts too much, and everyone is against me.  
- Life is unfair, Poor me.  
- The world is too scary and the challenges are too big  
- I need to be hard on myself  
  
## Balancing the Victim  
- If I'm attracting Bullies in my life, then the Victim energy is out of balance and taking over.   
- I get in touch with anger, strength and courage of the Bully  
- I remember that I am bigger than my fear, and I practice doing things that I'm afraid of.   
- I remember that having weakness, doesn't mean I'm weak.  
- I let go of the idea that the world is happening to me, and start making things happen myself.   
- I stop complaining and whining, and start taking action.   
- I develop self-discipline to strengthen my body and control my mind.   
- I use my anger to say "no" when my boundaries are crossed.   
- I remember that some things are worth fighting for.  
- I find more mature warriors and ask them to challenge me and train me.
