 The Weakling lacks centerednes, calmness, and security within himself. He doesn't feel his [power](/king/mature_king/power), and takes as little [responsibility](/king/mature_king/responsibility) as possible for the world around him, expecting others to take care of him, and attracting Tyrants into his life.  
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I act weak because I am disconnected from my [power](/king/mature_king/power)  
- I pretend not to care because I don't want to be humiliated  
- I take as little [responsibility](/king/mature_king/responsibility) as possible for my life and the lives of others  
- I depend on people to take care of my realm  
  
## Balancing the Weakling  
- If I'm attracting Tyrants into my life, that means the Weakling energy is out of [balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance) and taking over.  
- I stop letting others do for me what I can do for yourself.  
- I get in touch with the [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow). I feel his hatred and [power](/king/mature_king/power). I accept his qualities as a part of me.  
- I remember free choice, and claim my [freedom](/lover/spirit/jester/freedom) to live my life the way I want to.   
- I learn to overcome my fear of asking for what you want.  
- I remember that people need to keep their agreements with me.  
- I notice when I'm saying "yes", when I want to be saying "no".  
- I look for places where I'm not clear about the boundaries of my realm and clarify them.  
- I feel the [power](/king/mature_king/power) in my belly, and use it with my love to take care of myself and others.  
  
## Gift of the Weakling  
When the [King](/king/mature_king) is in [Tyrant](/king/mature_king/tyrant_shadow) shadow, he needs the gift of my [vulnerability](/warrior/mature_warrior/vulnerability). I help him to connect with his heart, and the limits of his [power](/king/mature_king/power), so that he can allow himself to not be in total control.   
  
**Off [Balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance):** Lets Chaos reign through powerlessness to bring Order  
**Qualities:** Guilt, Helplessness, Powerlessness, Avoidance
