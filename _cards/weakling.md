 The Weakling lacks centerednes, calmness, and security within himself. He doesn't feel his power, and takes as little responsibility as possible for the world around him, expecting others to take care of him, and attracting Tyrants into his life.  
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I act weak because I am disconnected from my power  
- I pretend not to care because I don't want to be humiliated  
- I take as little responsibility as possible for my life and the lives of others  
- I depend on people to take care of my realm  
  
## Balancing the Weakling  
- If I'm attracting Tyrants into my life, that means the Weakling energy is out of balance and taking over.  
- I stop letting others do for me what I can do for yourself.  
- I get in touch with the Tyrant. I feel his hatred and power. I accept his qualities as a part of me.  
- I remember free choice, and claim my freedom to live my life the way I want to.   
- I learn to overcome my fear of asking for what you want.  
- I remember that people need to keep their agreements with me.  
- I notice when I'm saying "yes", when I want to be saying "no".  
- I look for places where I'm not clear about the boundaries of my realm and clarify them.  
- I feel the power in my belly, and use it with my love to take care of myself and others.  
  
## Gift of the Weakling  
When the King is in Tyrant shadow, he needs the gift of my vulnerability. I help him to connect with his heart, and the limits of his power, so that he can allow himself to not be in total control.
