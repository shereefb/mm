|“Live so fully and so brilliantly that your pain diminishes in your aliveness.”   
  
|"Follow your bliss"  
  
|“When we move in a direction that touches our heart, we add to the momentum of deeper purpose that makes us feel more alive.”   
  
|"Life isn't meant to be lived perfectly, but merely to be lived. Boldly, wildly, beautifully, uncertainly, imperfectly, and magically lived."  
  
A [Lover](/lover/mature_lover)'s sensitive heart allows him to feel life's energy and passion, and his full belly grounds him to the earth. He needs to [balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance) his passion and [groundedness](/lover/mature_lover/groundedness) to enjoy the aliveness. The [addict](/lover/mature_lover/addict_shadow) feels passion without being grounded, so his aliveness is manic and volatile. The [Hermit](/lover/mature_lover/hermit_shadow) feels grounded without passion, so he is depressed and has no energy.   
Depression tries to ground us, remind us to connect to the earth. Mania reminds us to be alive. Balancing both brings us the aliveness of the [lover](/lover/mature_lover).   
  
The [Lover](/lover/mature_lover) appreciates life, because he respects death. Death reminds him how precious life is, and how short. The [addict](/lover/mature_lover/addict_shadow) pretends death doesn't no exist. The [hermit](/lover/mature_lover/hermit_shadow), lives in the shadow of death and has given up on life. The [Lover](/lover/mature_lover) remembers death, and lives life fully because of it.
