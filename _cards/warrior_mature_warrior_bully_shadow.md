 The Bully is a [Warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) who loses touch with his [vulnerability](/warrior/mature_warrior/vulnerability) and his sensitivity. He has the false belief that [Courage](/warrior/spirit/rebel/courage) means not being afraid, so he pretends not to be afraid and tries to control his feelings. Instead of using his [strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength) and agressiveness to serve the realm, he uses them to only serve his own interests. His anger becomes violent, and his actions cause unnecessary pain and suffering in others.   
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I am not afraid of anything. Nothing can hurt me.  
- I don't care about feelings  
- I hate weak people  
  
## Balancing the Bully  
- If I'm attracting Victims in my life then the Bully energy is out of [balance](/king/body/peace_maker/balance) and taking over.   
- I get in touch with the [vulnerability](/warrior/mature_warrior/vulnerability) and sensitivity of the [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow)  
- I remember that I need [love](/lover/heart/romantic/love) and connection to other people, and that my feelings and theirs matter.   
- I remember that [courage](/warrior/spirit/rebel/courage) doesn't mean not being afraid. I connect with my fear and accept it.  
- I remember that [strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength) doesn't mean not having weakness. I connect with my weakness and accept it.  
- I remember that I'm here to serve something greater than myself, and that my [strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength) was given to me to serve others.  
- I focus on using force only for protection  
- I let go of the idea that other people are my enemy.  
- I stop trying to control my feelings and the feelings of others.  
  
## Gift of the Bully  
If a [Warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) is stuck in [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow) energy, they need the gift of the bully's explosive anger in order to get back in touch with their [strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength).   
  
**Off [Balance](/king/body/peace_maker/balance):** Tries to override [vulnerability](/warrior/mature_warrior/vulnerability) with [Strength](/warrior/mature_warrior/strength)  
**Qualities:** Unhealthy Anger, Forcing, Coersion, Cruelty, Violence
