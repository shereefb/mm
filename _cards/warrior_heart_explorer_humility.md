 #draft The Mature [Warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) understands that dignity and defeat can co-exist. He knows that his value and [self-worth](/warrior/heart/explorer/self-worth) comes from how he meets winning or losing, not whether or not he wins or loses. He is graceful in winning, and dignified in losing.   
  
Victims and Bullies think that the only thing that matters is winning. They incorrectly think that their value and [self-worth](/warrior/heart/explorer/self-worth) comes from winning and avoiding losing.   
  
The [Bully](/warrior/mature_warrior/bully_shadow) does not acknowledge defeat. He gloats when winning, and gets enraged when losing.  To maintain a false sense of dignity, he forgets his defeats quickly and tries to move on. Never learning to be humble.  
  
The [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow) loses his dignity when defeated. He mopes when losing, and pretends to have false humility when winning. Because he's afraid of losing, he doesn't have the [courage](/warrior/spirit/rebel/courage) to try things that are challenging, and gets weaker with time.   
  
Because the [victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow) is humiliated by limitation and failure, he attracts bullies that humiliate him. Because the [Bully](/warrior/mature_warrior/bully_shadow) refuses humility, they humiliate others.   
  
The Mature [Warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) lets his limitation bring humility. He defends against bullying voices and keeps his dignity. He knows his worth and meets his limitations.  
He becomes like water. Staying close to the earth and respecting his limits. Like water, he uses patience and persistence to carve through rock.  
  
When the [Bully](/warrior/mature_warrior/bully_shadow) and [Victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow) fall to their knees, they are humiliated and hang their head down in shame. Their shame comes from not having tried their best before being defeated. When the [Warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) falls to his knees, he is humbled. Because he has tried his best, he is not humiliated. He connects to the source to reflect, heal and learn. He finds [balance](/king/body/ruler_and_judge/balance) again, and gets back on the battlefield.    
  
The [victim](/warrior/mature_warrior/victim_shadow) bends his head in self-pity. The [Warrior](/warrior/mature_warrior) bends his head down to look inwards, to reflect. To listen to his body and his heart.
