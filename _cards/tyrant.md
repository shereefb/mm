#printed The Tyrant exploits and abuses others. He is ruthless, merciless, and without feeling when he is pursuing what he thinks is his own self-interest. He hates all beauty, all innocence, all strength, all talent, all life energy. He does so because he lacks inner structure, and he is afraid of his own hidden weakness and his underlying lack of potency.  
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I use my power to boss people to get what I want and serve myself  
- Instead of responsibility, I try to take control.  
- I reject and attack weakness in myself and others.  
- Evil is out there, and can be squashed  
- I try to force order on everyone because I can't handle the chaos  
  
## Balancing the Tyrant  
- If I'm attracting weaklings into my life then the Tyrant energy is out of balance and taking over.  
- I get in touch with the Weakling. I feel his vulnerability and out of controlness, and I accept his qualities as a part of me.   
- I stop doing for others what they can do for themselves.   
- I respect other people's freedom to be who they are, and do what they want.  
- I focus on making requests and not demands.   
- I remember that nobody owes me anything unless they agreed to it.   
- I notice when people are saying "yes" just because they are scared of me.  
- I feel the compassion in my heart, and my love for people, and use my power to serve with love.   
- I notice and let go of my addiction to be needed so I can feel important.
