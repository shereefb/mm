 The Manipulator is a Magician who has lost touch with his higher purpose. Instead of guiding others to open their eyes, he controls them in ways they cannot see. Instead of initiating others and lifting them up, he uses his knowledge to keep them down and demonstrate his superiority. He withholds knowledge, and uses secrets to exploit others.   
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I use my skills and knowledge to control people and to serve myself.   
- I don't need to figure things out, because I already know.  
- I am better than others because I know more.    
- I compare myself to others and find ways that I'm better than them.  
- I don't aknowledge my failures.  
- I'm disconnected from the mystery.  
  
## Balancing the Manipulator  
- I get in touch with the wonder and "beginner's mind" of the Dummy to feel less arrogant, and more curious.   
- I remember that my knowledge was given to me by others, and that I have a duty to use it to benefit others, and to pass it on to others.  
- I begin comparing myself to my past self instead of to others.  
- I stop pretending to know everything and cultivate a beginner's mind.  
- I spend time in nature and connect with the spirit. This reminds me of the great mystery and my place in it.   
- I remember that there is so much I don't know and there is so much to learn.   
  
  
## Gift of the Manipulator  
When the Magician is in his Dummy shadow, he needs the gift of my confidence to get in touch with his ability to know, learn and grow, and not be lost in the mystery.   
  
**Off Balance:** Believes his knowledge is bigger than the mystery, so becomes arrogant and tries to control the mystery.   
**Qualities:** Grandiosity. Arrogance. Manipulative. Hustler.
