#printed The Hermit is a Lover who has lost touch with his aliveness and experiences life in an "unfeeling" way. He has a lack of enthusiasm, vividness and vitality. Bored and listless, he is isolated and disconnected from friends and family. He feels cut off from himself, and his heart is closed.   
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- Nothing brings me pleasure.   
- I'm too worried about future consequences to enjoy myself.  
- The past is too painful for me to enjoy myself now.   
- I get lost in my inner world to avoid connecting with others.   
- I avoid pain, humiliation, and betrayel by shutting down and having less experiences.  
  
  
## Balancing the Hermit  
- I learn to detach from my pain and grief. I am bigger than them.   
- I reach out to connect to others.  
- I accept that there is a very wide range of experiences of being alive and I welcome it all.  
- I recognize that love is everywhere, and there is no limit to it.  
- I learn to dance, breathe, and move my body so I can let my heart open and my emotions flow.  
- I practice spontaneity and following my bliss so I can ignite the passion inside of me.   
- I give and recieve touch to feel my body connecting to another and inhabit my sensuality.
