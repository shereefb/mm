 The Bully is a Warrior who loses touch with his vulnerability and his sensitivity. He has the false belief that Courage means not being afraid, so he pretends not to be afraid and tries to control his feelings. Instead of using his strength and agressiveness to serve the realm, he uses them to only serve his own interests. His anger becomes violent, and his actions cause unnecessary pain and suffering in others.   
  
  
## Shadow Declarations  
- I am not afraid of anything. Nothing can hurt me.  
- I don't care about feelings  
- I hate weak people  
  
## Balancing the Bully  
- If I'm attracting Victims in my life then the Bully energy is out of balance and taking over.   
- I get in touch with the vulnerability and sensitivity of the Victim  
- I remember that I need love and connection to other people, and that my feelings and theirs matter.   
- I remember that courage doesn't mean not being afraid. I connect with my fear and accept it.  
- I remember that strength doesn't mean not having weakness. I connect with my weakness and accept it.  
- I remember that I'm here to serve something greater than myself, and that my strength was given to me to serve others.  
- I focus on using force only for protection  
- I let go of the idea that other people are my enemy.  
- I stop trying to control my feelings and the feelings of others.
