###"The important thing is not to stop questioning. "  
  
  
###“It's not a silly question if you can't answer it.”   
  
  
###“Let go of certainty. The opposite isn't uncertainty. It's openness, curiosity and a willingness to embrace paradox, rather than choose up sides. The ultimate challenge is to accept ourselves exactly as we are, but never stop trying to learn and grow.”   
  
Curiosity is what drives the Magician to learn about the mystery, and to transform the world. The mature Magician wonders about everything, and wants to know how things work, what things are, and most importantly, wants to understand himself and connect to the spirit.   
  
The Manipulator is focused on having answers, because he is afraid of the mystery and wants to be in control. The Dummy feels humiliated and embarrassed by not knowing and so hides his curiosity, and pretends to know. The mature Magician enjoys the question, and loves asking it. The moment he gets an answer he finds the next question for the fun of it.   
  
When exploring with other people, the mature Magician always assumes other people know something that he doesn't. He tries to learn from them. The Manipulator thinks that he knows it all. He doesn't listen or ask questions, and just wants to show off what he knows. The Dummy doesn't want to reveal there's something he doesn't know, and doesn't share his knowledge because he feels insecure.
