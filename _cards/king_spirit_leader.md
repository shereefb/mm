Leadership means that you take agency. You see something missing or something that your heart longs for, or some possibility then it inspires you to create a New World. Leaders believe there’s a reason that there is a longing in their heart. They increased their measure of self worth  every day closing between the world as it is and the world their hearts know is possible. The enroll others. Inspire. Co-ordinate.   
  
There’s a balance between acceptance and gratitude and blessed unrest.
