              <outline text="Clarity" _note="#printed&#10;###“It’s a lack of clarity that creates chaos and frustration. Those emotions are poison to any living goal.”&#10;&#10;###“When things feel murky and unsure, fine tuning our hearing so as to distinguish the voice of our Innermost Self brings clarity.” &#10;&#10;A king needs a clear mind to see reality as it is, not how he would like it to be. He learns from the eagle how to soar above the details and look at the big picture. He learns from the air element how to not hold on to ideas, or opinions, and clear the mind to receive the information that&apos;s needed. When he is not clear, he learns to be in silence, and to wait for clarity. &#10;&#10;A Mature King does not confuse his mind for his brain. He makes sure his body and heart are clear, for he knows that the mind is not just in the head. In order to be clear, he must have a grounded belly, a content heart, and an empty mind. Clarity means the belly, the heart, and the mind are all aligned. &#10;&#10;The King learns to clear his mind by getting rest, connecting to nature, going for a walk, listening to music, or moving his body. Above all, like the eagle, he learns to connect to the sky, rise above the details, and wait until he sees what he is looking for. &#10;&#10;The Tyrant and the Weakling both do not have clarity. The Tyrant does not wait for clarity, and makes decisions and acts blindly. The Weakling doubts himself when clarity comes and doesn&apos;t trust his mind, or his seeing. &#10;"/>

He uses the hatred to connect to his power and serve the realm. &#10;&#10;He does this by feeling his hatred fully, and letting its energy fill his heart and his body, but never discharging it. By accepting the hatred in his body, not denying it, and not acting it out, he let&apos;s his body transform hatred into pure power. &#10;&#10;The Tyrant, feels the hatred, but cannot hold it in his body so he turns it outwards and discharges it. The Weakling, denies the hatred, and tries not to feel it. He represses it, and doesn&apos;t let it into his body. This way, he cuts himself off from his power. &#10;&#10;When the Tyrant discharges his power, he turns it outwards towards others in violence. The power then leaves his body and hurts others, leaving him weak and unbalanced. This Tyrant energy disturbs the peace and starts war. &#10;&#10;When the Weakling avoids owning his power he acts &quot;nice&quot; and pretends to like things he doesn&apos;t, and accepts things that don&apos;t work. He does this because he is afraid to lose the relationships in his life, and doesn&apos;t want to scare people with his power. Weakling energy creates a &quot;fake&quot; peace because the weakling is battling inside himself with hatred.&#10;&#10;When the King lets his power fill his body, mind, and heart, he is peaceful and centered. Pure power doesn&apos;t hurt anyone. It does not attack or violate others, and does not allow others to attack or violate. Mature King power creates true peace.&#10;&#10;"/>

              <outline text="Respect" _note="#draft &#10;###&quot;Over time we gain self-respect by grappling with our deficiencies, by learning that we can do that. If we run away from the difficult parts, we’ll feel like a coward. If we feel like a coward, we won’t respect ourselves. And we can’t lie to ourselves about what we’re actually doing; on a deep level, we know the truth. So we have to grapple with the difficulties in a courageous way. That’s how we gain respect and value.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When you are being your true self, you are not looking for pleasure, you are not avoiding pain, you are not trying to get approval, nor trying to get someone to admire you. You are not out to criticize someone else, or to defeat someone else, and you are not out to gain fame or power. You are naturally and spontaneously living as a genuine human being who has respect andconsideration for other human beings. ……….. To make these values and manifestations second nature, you have to put conscious effort into them. You have to make it your work. This does not mean that you have to be solemn and grim and serious; that is not the point. The point is to act with sincerity and to put conscious effort into being aware of yourself and others in order to treat yourself and others with respect. This also does not mean giving up pleasure; it means not seeking pleasure. It does not mean creating pain; it means not avoiding pain. Life is to be lived with the integrity, dignity, and self-respect of a person who knows that the point is not whether something feels good or bad. The point is not to lose your self-respect, not to abandon your true reality, the highest and purest elements within you. Regardless of how wonderful things are and regardless of how painful things are, your self-respect is strong enough to maintain your sense of integrity. That integrity does not mean having your way, or winning or succeeding or anything like that. It means being sincere about who you are and acting in ways that reflect your essential human values.&quot;&#10;&#10;- Self respect, means having a good reputation with yourself. Keeping your word to yourself. Making decisions and taking actions in a way that makes you like yourself. &#10;- When we treat ourselves with respect and set good boundaries, we teach other people how we want to be treated. &#10;- Tyrant demands respect. Weakling doesn&apos;t respect self. &#10;- King earns respect, by first respecting himself. &#10;- Respects the queen and the feminine. Everything is born of the feminine&#10;- Respects himself and the masculine. Everything is sparked by the masculine&#10;- Re-spect means to look again. To honor the sanctity of everything. &#10;- Not criticizing self or others. Tyrant criticizes others. Weakling criticizes self and lets others criticize him. King accepts himself and others. &#10;- King apologizes with self respect. appropriate remorse and regret. Tyrants lives unapologitecially. Weakling diminishes himself in shame when he apologizes. &#10;- Respects his body. Tyrant controls his body. Weakling neglects his body. &#10;- Respecting the earth, our environment, our word, our limitations, Respect opposition and enemy. Respect their shadow. &#10;- Spend time with respectful and self-respecting people&#10;- We gain self respect and self-worth by confronting the challenges in our lives head on and doing our best. &#10;- People with Self Respect: &#10;	Honor their values and morals more often than not.&#10;	Speak about themselves confidently but with appropriate humility.&#10;	Dress in a way that reflects the positive way they feel about themselves.&#10;	Have a personal mission statement or personal operating system to guide them.&#10;	Admit their flaws and mistakes and work to improve them.&#10;	Don&apos;t allow other people to take advantage of them or speak down to them.&#10;	Know when to leave a compromising or unhealthy situation or relationship.&#10;	Treat their bodies and minds with care and honor.&#10;	Can show respect to others who merit it.&#10;	Recognize that their time, energy, and resources are valuable.&#10;	Can create appropriate boundaries with others.&#10;	Don&apos;t need to apologize for who they are.&#10;	Take personal responsibility for all of their actions.&#10;	Don&apos;t feel diminished by constructive criticism or advice.&#10;	Keep trying in the face of adversity and don&apos;t give up on themselves.&#10;&#10;		"/>

He doesn&apos;t understand that avoiding responsibility is the opposite of freedom. The less responsibility he takes, the weaker he gets, which leads to taking less responsibility. This makes the weakling always depend on other people to take care of his realm. He becomes less free, and attracts tyrants into his life who will manipulate and control him. &#10;&#10;The Tyrant tries to control others. This makes them weak and keeps him in control. He does things for others that they can do for themselves. He loses his freedom this way because he attracts weaklings into his life that demand that he takes care of them. Because he is always trying to control everything, the Tyrant can never relax or rest, and is never free.&#10;&#10;The Mature King understands that the more he is responsible for others, the free-er he his. He takes as much responsibility as he can, and expects others to be responsible for themselves. He learns from the wolf. He leads his pack but expects them to be responsible. This allows him to play with them as equals. He doesn&apos;t control them, and doesn&apos;t leave them. As part of a pack, he makes sure he is contributing and carrying his own weight. If he needs help he asks for it, until he can get back on his feet. If he&apos;s asked for help, he gives it only to the point where the other wolf can take care of himself. If a wolf does not take care of his responsibilities, eventually the pack leaves him, and he learns the hard way to take care of himself. &#10;&#10;## Mature Responsibility Principles&#10;- Define clear boundaries for your realm&#10;- Take full responsibility for everything inside your realm, and don&apos;t take responsibility for anything outside it&#10;- Take full responsibility for your feelings, actions, and needs&#10;- Don&apos;t take responsibility for other people&apos;s feelings, actions, or needs&#10;- Only help when someone asks for help and don&apos;t push your help on anyone&#10;- Don&apos;t let anyone do something for you that you can do for yourself&#10;- Don&apos;t do something for someone that they can do for themselves&#10;- Expand your realm every day by increasing what you&apos;re responsible for&#10;- Respect other&apos;s freedom to live their lives and make their own choices"/>

When the Bully tells the truth, they don&apos;t care about people’s heart and just blurt it out. Because they do this without kindness, the truth does not penetrate. It hurts. &#10;&#10;The Victim keeps the truth in because they are trying to be kind. They lie to themselves and others. Because they are afraid to hurt people they put down their sword of truth. This means they also can&apos;t hear other warriors&apos; feedback because it hurts them. &#10;&#10;Honesty can be scary. It requires a warriors courage. The hardest kind of honesty, is honesty with yourself.&#10;&#10;The Mature Warrior tells the truth and includes the fact that he cares about their (feelings heart- don&apos;t understand) as part of the truth. He lets other people&apos;s feedback impact him without taking it personally.&#10;&#10;## Honesty Principles &#10;- Never lie. &#10;- Say what you mean, mean what you say. &#10;- Stop speaking if someone isn’t listening. Your words are too precious to waste. &#10;- Confront lies, and untruths in yourself and others. &#10;- Don’t say things that make you feel weaker. &#10;- Hold your opinions lightly. &#10;- Assume there’s always more truth than what you can see. &#10;- Go into silence until you know the truth.&#10;- Real kindness is being honest **and** open-hearted.&#10;&#10;"/>

Fear is what warns you when when things are dangerous. Fear is what makes you prepare. Fear keeps us out of a lot of trouble. So there is nothing wrong with fear. But fear can also be overwhelming. It can be unreasonable. It can cause you to freeze up and make bad decisions or hesitate when you need to act. So you have to learn to control fear. &#10;&#10;And that&apos;s what courage is. Learning that we are bigger than fear. Learning to listen to it, but not let it control us. Learning to respect fear, but put it in its place. So we can act when we need to act, grow when we need to grow, and face what we need to face. &#10;&#10;Bullies don&apos;t accept their fear. The deny it and so they scare others. Victims feel their fear, but they let it take charge of their lives and make all the decisions. A true warrior lets himself be afraid, and makes his decision including the fear, but also including many other factors. &#10;&#10;&#10; "/>

He mopes when losing, and pretends to have false humility when winning. Because he&apos;s afraid of losing, he doesn&apos;t have the courage to try things that are challenging, and gets weaker with time. &#10;&#10;Because the victim is humiliated by limitation and failure, he attracts bullies that humiliate him. Because the Bully refuses humility, they humiliate others. &#10;&#10;The Mature Warrior lets his limitation bring humility. He defends against bullying voices and keeps his dignity.

To do this, the magician studies the way his body and his soul are connected. He creates sacred spaces in the physical world and tends them. Alters. Temples. He collects and respects sacred objects and symbols. He spends time in nature. He learns the way of the artist, bringing spirit into form through dance, music, poetry, painting, sculpting, and prayer. He learns to make his body, heart and mind and instrument for spirit to play. &#10;&#10;This is the Mature Magician as Priest. It is the vertical connection.

He needs to balance his passion and groundedness to enjoy the aliveness. The addict feels passion without being grounded, so his aliveness is manic and volatile. The Hermit feels grounded without passion, so he is depressed and has no energy. &#10;Depression tries to ground us, remind us to connect to the earth. Mania reminds us to be alive. Balancing both brings us the aliveness of the lover. &#10;&#10;The Lover appreciates life, because he respects death. Death reminds him how precious life is, and how short. The addict pretends death doesn&apos;t no exist. The hermit, lives in the shadow of death and has given up on life. The Lover remembers death, and lives life fully because of it. "/>
