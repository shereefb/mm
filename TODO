Breakup sections into cards and booklet/website?

Create a page for every node in the OPML.
Each page automatically has a section at the bottom that points to it's children (and recursively all of its children), and creates an outline.
If there's no content in the node, then the page is just a menu page.

Figure out a way for side navigation to only pickup pages with content in them

Consider generating the breadcrumbs in the page itself?

If there's content, search in it for all node names and titles (aliases?) and link to them so that content is cross-linked.

Page we're on gets highlighted in side-bar navigation
